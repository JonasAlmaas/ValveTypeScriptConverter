# CS2 TypeScript Converter

Based of [Ansimist's cs2typescript](https://github.com/Ansimist/cs2typescript)

This program converts Typescript files to Valve Typescript files (`vts_c`).  
Run the program with the `-h` flag to get some documentation.

## Including a script in your map

- Add an entity of class `point_script`
- Add the `script` key to the entity and write the path to the file there
- Add the `targetname` key to the entity and write the name of the entity there
